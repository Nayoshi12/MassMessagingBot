## What is Mass Messaging Discord Bot?
Mass Messaging Discord Bot is a discord bot written in node.js with express and express-handlebars as it's web server. It allows a person of authority to be able to personally message using the bot.

## What is it able to do?
It is able to select a channel where it can message a log where it can say who is and isn't able to messaged. It can select a role where it can ignore that role, and that role will never be messaged.

## Why was it created?
Often times, people in discord server mute their notification, and while they anxiously await for an announcement. People forget that those updates happen, and they are left behind and not informed. So this is created to personally message everyone.

## Can I use this?
Probably not, this was created as a test program to see if I can implement an web interface to Discord, and also be able to handle rate limits, and dealing with thousand upon thousand of users in a timely manner. 

You cannot use this program because this is classified as a api abuse by Discord Terms of Service. Use this program as a reference, never use it in a proper bot.

I am not responsible for your account being banned by Discord, use this at your own risk.

Have fun learning.
